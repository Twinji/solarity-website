                <h1>ABOUT</h1>
                <h3>A PASSION FOR THE UNKNOWN</h3><br/>
                It's a common activity amongst us, as human beings, to ponder about the world we live in.
                Our curiousity and willingness to learn has and will only continue to fuel our struggles to hunt the truth - to find the answers to our never ending list of questions.
                Here at Solarity, it is our passion for this very idea that sparked the creation of our company.
                We want to bring people close in their common interests, and build a community that will one day create pioneers that make revolutionary discoveries.
                <br/><br/>
                To do this, we have collaborated with leading space organisations such as NASA and SpaceX to provide students with the knowledge they require to pursue their dreams and ambitions.
                We offer education in the fields of maths, physics, and other sciences, with a primary focus on astronomy.
                The content we provide is completely classroom friendly, and is suitable for many age groups, ranging from grade 4 to university.
                As of now, the services we provide are limited, however, we plan to expand to a global scale.
                <br/><br/>
                Our organisation is currently based in South Australia, but we have many employers working with us online from around the globe.
                As stated earlier, we hope to expand to a global scale once we reach a sufficient amount of followers.
                As of now our team consists of one member (me), but we are reaching out to employ more talented people.
                <br/><br/>
                So join us, in our journey to push the limits of what is currently possible.
